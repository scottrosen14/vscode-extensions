# Change Log

### 2.4.2 - 7 October 2018

* Adjusted time format regex to match single-digit hours and to not require 3 digits for the fraction of a second part.

* Fixed bug that the initial bracket was colored as a string quote in this example: ['a']

### 2.4.1 - 9 September 2018

* Exclude coloring of patterns that looks like namespaces (a non-whitespace character sequence with at least one dot) when surrounded by slash or backslash characters.

  Should stop coloring of `foo.bar` in cases like these:

  ```
  c:\foo.bar\lorem
  /etc/foo.bar/lorem
  ```

### 2.4.0 - 23 April 2018

* Added some levels based on Syslog severity levels such as `EMERGENCY`, `ALERT`, `CRITICAL`, and `NOTICE`. Contributed by Mulia Nasution.

### 2.3.0 - 21 April 2018

* Added NLog log levels: Fatal, Error, Warn, Info, Debug and Trace

* Fixed bug in the duration calculation feature so that it only looks for times and dates at the beginning of log lines.

### 2.2.0 - 15 April 2018

* Added CI builds in Travis (found [here](https://travis-ci.org/emilast/vscode-logfile-highlighter)) and a Travis badge in the Readme file.

* Added support for multiline expressions in the custom highlighting patterns feature. Allows the use of `^` and `$` for indicating the begin and end of lines respectively.

* Removed highlighting of file system paths. It was hard to define in a fool proof way and since there is no way to turn it off, it's better to let people add that highlighting using the custom highlighting patterns feature.

* Protected string constant matching from matching quotes in abbreviated phrases such as `donÂ´t`,

### 2.1.1 - 15 Feb 2018

* Updated readme file:
  * Added a note about that an earlier version of the extension has now been incorporated into the standard Visual Studio Code installation.
  * Added an animated GIF showcasing the custom pattern highlighting feature.

### 2.1.0 - 14 Feb 2018

* New feature: **Custom highlighting patterns**
  * LogFileHighlighter can now be configured to add highlighting to user-specified patterns.
  * This can be used to adapt the extension to unsupported logging frameworks, to highlight domain specific patterns or just about anything else.
  * Feature contributed by Leo Hanisch ([@HaaLeo)](https://github.com/HaaLeo). Greatly appreciated, Leo!

* File system paths are now highlighted. Applies to both Windows-style paths (`C:\Windows`) and Unix-style (`/dev/null`).

* Added dash (`-`) to be allowed in "namespace" names. Makes text such as `vscode.merge-conflict` to be colored correctly.

### 2.0.0 - 6 Feb 2018

* New feature: **Visualization of Time Duration**
  * Select two or more lines and the time difference between the first and last log event is shown in the status bar.
  * Big thanks to Leo Hanisch ([@HaaLeo)](https://github.com/HaaLeo) for implementing this feature!

* Git hashes are now colored.

* Custom token for overriding exception types has changed from `log.type` to `log.exceptiontype`, which makes more sense.


### 1.2.0 - 19 Sep 2017

* New feature: Customization of colors that overrides the default (which is to reuse theme colors). Fixes issues #24 and #27.

### 1.1.1 - 11 Feb 2017

* Fixed bug that concatenated dates and times stopped being highlighted in version 1.1.0.

### 1.1.0 - 10 Feb 2017

* Added the Serilog log level abbreviations to the matched patterns. This means that `[eror]`, `[wrn]` etc are now correctly colored. (initiated and assisted by @Leon99).

* Added a few patterns that seem common in the Javascript world, such as `error:` and `warning:`.

* Adjusted the patterns for dates so that we highlight dates and clock times separately as suggested by @Leon99.

* Moved the extension back into the [Other section](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Other) of the marketplace which seems to be the proper category after all...


### 1.0.1 - 1 Dec 2016

* Added a dot (`.`) as an allowed separator between seconds and milliseconds in datetime values, as suggested in [issue 12](https://github.com/emilast/vscode-logfile-highlighter/issues/12).

* Moved the extension into the new [Formatters section](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VSCode&category=Formatters) of the marketplace.

### 1.0.0 - 11 Sep 2016

* Fixed bug that GUIDs that start with a pure numerical digit sequences were not colored correctly. 

* Changed the Visual Studio Code version requirement to be at least `1.0.0` (rather than having an old pre-release requirement),
  which should fix some incompatibility problems with VS Code 1.6. 

### 0.9.0 - 23 Aug 2016

* Added highlighting of culture specific dates (fixes issue #8).
* Added highlighting of lower case GUIDs (fixes issue #7).

### 0.8.0 - 26 Jul 2016

* Added highlighting of time zone parts in dates (fixes issue #5).
* Added highlighting of GUIDs (fixes issue #6).

### 0.7.0 - 19 Apr 2016

* Adjusted the coloring for DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, constants, exceptions and stack traces to remain compatible with Visual Studio Code 1.0.

### 0.6.0 - 22 Feb 2016

* Added icon to Marketplace manifest.
* Added coloring of Url:s and namespaces.
* Changed the color of exception stack traces to be a little more discreet. 

### 0.5.11 - 29 Dec 2015

* A recent VS Code update caused exception call stacks to be uncolored for some reason. Changed so that they use the same color as the exception name.

### 0.5.10 - 16 Dec 2015

* Fixed bug that dates were colored the same way as constants.

### 0.5.9 - 15 Dec 2015

* Added coloring of **string constants** enclosed with single or double quotes.
* Added new constants `null`, `true` and `false`, colored the same way as numeric constants.
